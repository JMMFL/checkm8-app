## Description
[Checkm8](https://checkm8.me/) is a small web app for checking <i>Chess.com</i> player stats and match history.
Profile pages display chess titles, ladder ratings, recent performance, social links, game accuracies, and more. This project was inspired by [opgg](https://na.op.gg/).
<br><br>

## Code
I used React with a lightweight Chess.com API wrapper:
- **React:** State Management, Functional Components, Styled Components, React Router and Hooks
- **CSS:** Grid and Flex Box
- **Data:** Fetch API, Promises, Async / Await, ES6+
<br><br>

## Tools
- **Figma –** I created a mobile mockup for project guidance and pixel-perfect CSS.
- [chess-web-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess-web-api) – I used this package to collect profile data and pass them through state.
<br><br>

## Resources
- **Roboto –** https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
- **Icons8 –** https://icons8.com/
<br><br>

## To-do
- [ ] Fix UI from moving up when user opens keyboard.
